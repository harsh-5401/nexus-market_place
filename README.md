# Nexus Marketplace

A beautiful listing platform where users can browse items posted by others.

## What I Built

I created a modern website where people can see items that others are selling. Each listing shows:
- The seller's name and contact info
- Whether the seller is active or not
- A picture of the item
- A description of what's being sold

## Technologies I Used

### Frontend Framework
- **React**: I used React to build the user interface
- **TypeScript**: For adding type safety to my code
- **Vite**: As a fast build tool that makes development quicker

### Styling
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling everything without writing much CSS
- **Shadcn UI**: For ready-made components that look nice
- **Custom CSS**: Some extra styling to make things look even better

### State Management
- **Redux Toolkit**: To manage data across the whole app
- **React Redux**: To connect Redux with React components

### Routing
- **React Router**: To create different pages in the app

### Other Tools
- **React Toastify**: For showing nice notification messages
- **Axios**: For fetching data (simulated in this project)

## Features

- **Dark/Light Mode**: Users can switch between dark and light themes
- **Responsive Design**: Works on phones, tablets, and computers
- **Search**: Users can search for items by name or description
- **View Toggle**: Switch between card view and table view
- **Item Details**: Click on an item to see more information
